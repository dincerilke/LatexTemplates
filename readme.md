# Latex Helper Templates


This is a collection of my Latex files that have been very helpful during uni. 


- `longformnotes` is designed to be a long document that contains notes from units. To me, this has been my massive reference file for a unit, kinda like a mini textbook for the unit
  - Has a lot of customisation/speciality things I've added for units as I've needed them
- `1pagers` is a template for when you need 1 page (or 2) of notes to take into a test. It's compacted and compressed, and can contain a hell of a lot of content. 
  - Fairly simple, not much fancy stuff going on here. 

## Features/Optional Things

The longformnote has a few bespoke things that I've added to my latex setup over the years. The 'features' (more really options) are:

- Index notes in Margins: `marginnotes`
  - Sometimes you need to print all your notes. Hyperlinks don't really work here, but adding index entries to the margins of document means it's easy to find what you want with a physical copy. 
  - Note that this is really finicky, be careful with changes
- List of Algorithms/Pseudocode
  - Creates a list of figures style list of algorithms
- Boxes
  - Creates a few different boxes (like callouts) that I use to mark examples, important information, etc.
- Code
  - Obviously including code is very useful for reports, there's not really much custom stuff here but it's a good reminder of my preferred ways to include code (there's a lot of options)
- Maths Stuff
  - I've created a few helper functions/stuff for my maths
