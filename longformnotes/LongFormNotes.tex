\section{Testing Boxes}

\begin{example-box}
  I use blue boxes for examples. 
\end{example-box}


\begin{important-box}
Important boxes are green. 
\end{important-box}

\begin{proof-box}
  And proofs are in yellow. 
\end{proof-box}

Box colours and names can be altered in \texttt{ilke\_boxes.sty}. \\


The todo tag looks like \TODO, there's also \CITATION.

\section{Outlines}

\begin{outline}
\0 This isn't anything custom, just a package from the internet
  \1 But it's a very useful, very manual, way of doing dot point lists
    \2 sometimes itemize and enumerate get too bulky
      \3 level 3
        \4 level 4 is the max
  \1[+] a pro is the easy custom bullet points too
  \1[-] a con is you have to manually change levels if you change your mind about order
\end{outline}


\section{Algorithms}
Sometimes it's nice to write algorithms out in pseudocode, and you want to have a nice list of all of them (\textit{*cough* data structures and algorithms *cough*}). 


\begin{algorithm}[H]
    \caption{Insertion Sort}
    \label{alg:insertionsort}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \setlength{\commentWidth}{7cm}
    \SetKwFunction{length}{length}

    \KwIn{A sequence of $n$ numbers ($a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$)}
    \KwOut{A reordering ($b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$) of the input sequence such that $b_1 \leq b_2 \leq \ldots \leq b_n$}

    \For(\atcp{$c_1$, $n$ (condition is checked $n$ times)}) {$j=2$ \KwTo $\length(A)$}{ 
        $key = A[j]$ \atcp{$c_2$, $n-1$ (loop executed once less)} \;
        $i=j-1$ \atcp{$c_3$, $n-1$} \;
        \While(\atcp{$c_4$, $\sum_{j=2}^n (t_j + 1)$}){$i>0$ and $A[i]>key$}{
            $A[i=1] = A[i]$ \atcp{$c_5$, $\sum_{j=2}^n (t_j)$} \;
            $i=i-1$ \atcp{$c_6$, $\sum_{j=2}^n (t_j)$} \;
        }
        $A[i+1] = key$ \atcp{$c_7$, $n-1$} \;
    }
\end{algorithm}

\section{Code}

Minted is my package of choice for including code in latex files. It does really nice looking notes, but requires the python package \texttt{Pygments} to be installed, see \href{https://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/minted/minted.pdf}{docs} for more info. Can do \mintinline{python}{inline code} too. \\


A code snippet is done by 
\begin{minted}{python}
def hi():
  print("hi")
\end{minted}

Can caption code and include code in a list of source codes (also called a list of listings) by putting the code snippet inside a listing environment. 

\begin{listing}[!ht]
\begin{minted}{c}
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!"); /*printf() outputs the quoted string*/
   return 0;
}
\end{minted}
\caption{Hello World in C}
\label{listing:c}
\end{listing}



Can also include external files. 
\begin{listing}[!ht]
\inputminted{python}{resources/example.py}
\caption{Example from external file}
\label{listing:external}
\end{listing}


Can get a list of codes (list of listings) with 
\listoflistings

\bigskip
For colour schemes available in minted see the \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Code_Highlighting_with_minted#Reference_guide}{reference guide}.\\


A very minimalist code highlight package is \texttt{listings}. Doesn't look as good, but doesn't require any python or external packages. 

\section{Maths}

See the maths equation $$R_H = \frac{V_H \times t}{B \times I} = \frac{1}{q\times n} = \rho \mu$$

The \textit{conditions} environment from ilke\_maths can be used to create a nice table of definitions for terms in the equation, like below. \textit{conditions*} does the same thing, but wraps according to linewidth (takes marginally longer to compile if that matters) 

\begin{conditions}
  I & current through the sensor \\
  B & the flux density ($T$) \\
  t & thickness of sensor (m) \\
  q & electronic charge ($1.5\times10^{19} C$) \\
  n & carrier density ($m^{-3}$) \\
  \mu & carrier mobility ($cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}$) \\
  \rho & resistivity ($\Omega m^{-1}$) of the material \\
\end{conditions}

\section{Margin Notes}
This is a very useful setup if you are printing your notes (like when an exam is open book but limited to printed materials in the exam room).

Hyperlinks work great in files on computers, but not so much on paper. 

Beware, that this package is a little finicky and may not graphically look as you might want straight away. Index entries might overlap text, page numbers might disappear, etc. But nothing should properly break, it just won't be formatted as nicely (which may be a dealbreaker tbh). \index{Disclaimer}\\

Subentries exist too, but only one level deep. \index{Disclaimer!Subentry}\\ 


Note that the index will always put itself on a new page. And seems to break headers, but only on the first page of the index. \\


It may be useful to add extra space to the margins, especially if your index is long and many are close together. \index{Wow what a very very very long index entry}

See, the index margin notes are overlapping\index{Oops}. \\


You can also set up the document as a twosides, with the index entries showing on the opposite margins sides (so they're always on the outside of the two page spread) (set twoside, openright in the documentclass options) \\

This is a good setting for margins: usepackage[a4paper, inner=2cm, outer=4cm, bottom=2cm, marginparwidth=3.5cm]{geometry}
